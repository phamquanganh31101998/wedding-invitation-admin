# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tenant Management feature enables administrators to create, manage, and configure wedding tenant spaces within the Wedding Invitation Administrator system. Each tenant represents a unique wedding with associated bride/groom information, venue details, and customization settings. This feature provides the foundational multi-tenant architecture that allows the system to serve multiple wedding couples simultaneously while maintaining data isolation.

## Glossary

- **Tenant**: A unique wedding space containing bride/groom names, wedding date, venue information, and theme settings
- **Administrator**: An authenticated user with permissions to manage tenant configurations
- **Wedding_System**: The Wedding Invitation Administrator application
- **Tenant_Database**: The data storage system containing tenant information and configurations
- **Theme_Configuration**: Customizable color schemes and styling options for each tenant

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new wedding tenants, so that each couple can have their own dedicated space for managing their wedding invitations.

4. THE Wedding_System SHALL generate a unique tenant identifier for each created tenant
5. WHEN a tenant is successfully created, THE Wedding_System SHALL redirect the administrator to the tenant management dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and manage existing wedding tenants, so that I can oversee all active wedding spaces and their configurations.
